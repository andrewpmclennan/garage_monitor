# garage_monitor

This is the code base for using a raspberry pi to monitor various activities in my garage. In the long run it may involve power monitoring and other stuff. 

# TODO:
1. Need a connection system to send commands to the raspberrypi from a remote client.
2. Need a connection system to send commands locally (if applicable).
